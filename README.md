##Description

Task was to make your webpage using ruby. It must follow the appropriate file structure.

##Technology used

Ruby

##Problems

Trying to understand how everything flows in a step by step procedure was difficult to get my head around. 

Guide given was useful, however still need to practice and try impliment this myself would prove to be a challenge .

##Takeaways
